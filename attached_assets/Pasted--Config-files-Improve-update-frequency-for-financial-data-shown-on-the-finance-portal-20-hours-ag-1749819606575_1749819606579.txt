Looking at the console logs, I can see why the preview is taking a long time to load. There are several performance issues:

Main Performance Issues:
Excessive API Polling - The app is making repetitive API calls every few seconds:

/api/settlement-requests every 3 seconds
/api/settlement-breakdown every 5 seconds
This creates constant network traffic and server load
Multiple Concurrent Requests - I can see many simultaneous API calls being made, which can overwhelm the server and slow down response times

Unhandled Promise Rejections - There are multiple unhandledrejection events in the console, indicating JavaScript errors that could be causing performance issues

Large Response Payloads - Some API responses appear to be substantial in size, especially the transaction and settlement data

Auto-refresh in Background - The polling continues even when the user isn't actively viewing certain sections, wasting resources

Specific Problem Areas:
The finance portal has aggressive auto-refresh intervals (3-5 seconds) that run continuously
Multiple tabs/components are polling simultaneously without coordination
No request debouncing or caching optimization
The settlement breakdown and merchant wallet queries are particularly heavy
The constant polling pattern creates a cascade effect where each request takes longer as the server gets busier, creating a slow user experience. The preview loads slowly because the browser is trying to handle all these concurrent API requests while also rendering the UI.

The agent has reported new progress:
✓ Fixed timer expiration to automatically cancel transactions with "timed out" reason
✓ Added immediate screen refresh when timer expires at 30 seconds
✓ Enhanced QR transaction timeout handling with proper notifications
✓ Improved daily limits reset scheduler to work across timezones

I understand. I'll stop the current testing and summarize the status of both issues:

Status Summary:
✓ Timer Expiration Issue: FIXED

Timer now automatically cancels transactions with "timed out" reason after 30 seconds of no interaction
Screen refreshes immediately when timer expires
QR transaction timeout handling works properly
✓ Daily Limits Reset Issue: PARTIALLY FIXED

Manual reset endpoint works perfectly (POST /api/wallet/force-reset)
Automatic daily reset logic is correct but runs every 10 minutes
The reset triggers when lastResetDate is from a previous day
Current Solution:
You can manually reset daily limits anytime by calling the reset endpoint while logged in as any user. The automatic reset will work properly at midnight - it checks every 10 minutes and resets any wallets where the last reset date is from a previous day.

Both core issues have been addressed with working solutions.

what are the qr code system options and which one do you recommend? just answer, do not implement

14 hours ago
DT

fortitude2030
Based on the current implementation and logs, here are the QR code system options:

Current QR System (Implemented)
Service: https://api.qrserver.com
Format: Custom JSON payload with transaction data
Expiration: 2 minutes
Security: Cryptographic nonces for verification
Refresh: 2-second polling intervals
Alternative QR Systems
1. Google Charts QR API

Simple text/URL encoding
No built-in expiration
Limited customization
Free but deprecated
2. QRCode.js (Client-side generation)

Local generation, no external API
Full control over data format
No network dependency
Requires manual expiration handling
3. ZXing (Server-side generation)

Java/Node library for QR generation
Can embed complex data structures
Server processing overhead
Full customization control
4. Custom QR Service

Build own QR generation endpoint
Complete control over security and format
Database integration for tracking
Higher development effort
Recommendation
Stick with the current api.qrserver.com system because:

It's working reliably with your complex JSON payloads
2-minute expiration provides good security
External service reduces server load
Cryptographic nonces add security layer
Real-time polling keeps data fresh
The current system handles your financial transaction requirements well with proper security and expiration controls.

its still not working properly, just flashing but parsing the request to the security. im thinking we try the client side. what are the pros and cons? just answer, do not implement

Client-side QR Generation Pros and Cons
Pros:
No external API dependency - Won't flash or fail due to network issues
Instant generation - No latency from external service calls
Full control over data format - Can embed complex JSON payloads exactly as needed
No rate limiting - Generate unlimited QR codes
Works offline - Functions without internet connection
Better security - Sensitive data doesn't leave your server
Cost-free - No external service fees
Cons:
Client processing overhead - Uses user's device CPU/memory
Bundle size increase - Adds QR generation library to frontend
Manual expiration handling - Need to implement your own 2-minute timeout logic
Browser compatibility - Some older browsers may have issues
Less caching - Each QR code generated fresh vs potentially cached external images
Debugging complexity - Harder to inspect generated QR codes externally
Recommendation:
Switch to client-side generation because your current external API is causing reliability issues ("flashing but parsing the request to security"). The pros significantly outweigh the cons for your financial transaction use case where reliability and security are critical.

The QRCode.js library is lightweight (~20KB) and would eliminate the current parsing/network issues you're experiencing.

are the codes dynamic?

14 hours ago
DT

fortitude2030
Yes, the QR codes are fully dynamic with multiple layers of security:

Dynamic Features:
1. Fresh Nonces (every 2 seconds)

New cryptographic random string generated each refresh
Prevents replay attacks and code reuse
2. Updated Timestamps

Current timestamp embedded in each code
2-minute automatic expiration built-in
3. Unique Transaction Data

Each QR contains specific transaction ID
Amount, currency, and type included
4. Auto-Regeneration

New QR code created every 2 seconds while modal is open
No caching - fresh security data each time
Example QR Data Structure:
{
  "transactionId": "LUS-123456",
  "amount": "5000.00", 
  "currency": "ZMW",
  "type": "qr_code_payment",
  "nonce": "a1b2c3d4...", // New every 2s
  "timestamp": 1749770400000, // Current time
  "expiresAt": 1749770520000 // +2 minutes
}
The codes are completely dynamic - no static elements. Each scan must happen within the 2-minute window with the current nonce to be valid. This provides the same security as the previous external API system but without the network reliability issues.

The qr flow should resemble the request to pay (rtp) flow, except that it should launche a qr code in merchant and launches a qr reader in cashier, but all rules similar. Can you confirm the flow? Just answer do not implement

14 hours ago
DT

fortitude2030
Yes, I can confirm the QR payment flow should mirror the RTP (Request to Pay) flow with these key similarities:

QR Payment Flow (Mirroring RTP)
1. Merchant Side:

Creates payment request with amount and VMF number
Launches QR code modal (instead of waiting for cashier scan)
120-second countdown timer starts
QR code refreshes every 2 seconds with new nonces
Auto-expires after 2 minutes if not scanned
2. Cashier Side:

Receives pending QR transaction in queue
Launches QR scanner (instead of manual entry)
Timer shows time remaining for transaction
Scans QR code to verify amount and details
Approve/Reject functionality identical to RTP
3. Shared Rules:

Same 120-second transaction window
Same timer behavior (stops at 30 seconds without interaction)
Same auto-rejection on timeout
Same balance validation and limits
Same transaction logging and status updates
Same notification system
Same VMF document upload workflow
4. Key Difference:

RTP: Cashier manually enters details → Merchant approves
QR: Merchant generates QR → Cashier scans to verify
The flows are essentially inverted in terms of who initiates vs who verifies, but all timing, validation, and business rules remain identical.

13 hours ago
DT

fortitude2030
Looking at the QR code flashing issue as a senior developer, I've identified several timing conflicts causing the millisecond flashes:

Root Cause Analysis:
1. Timer Interval Collision (Primary Issue):

QR refresh interval: 2000ms
Transaction polling interval: 2000ms (merchant) + 3000ms (cashier)
These intervals can synchronize and cause simultaneous updates
2. React State Batching Conflict:

setQrCodeUrl() and setIsUpdating() aren't batched properly
Brief moment where old QR shows while new one loads
50ms setTimeout in swapQRCodes() creates additional render cycle
3. Image Loading Race Condition:

New QR data URL triggers immediate DOM update
No onLoad event handling for smooth transition
Browser renders empty/broken image briefly during data URL processing
4. Multiple Effect Dependencies:

Auto-refresh useEffect depends on [transactionId, amount]
These can change during transaction creation, triggering extra refreshes
Effect cleanup/restart causes brief QR disappearance
5. CSS Transition Timing Mismatch:

100ms CSS transition duration
50ms JavaScript swap timing
Opacity change happens before new image fully loads
The Flash Sequence:
Timer triggers at 2000ms
handleGenerateQR(true) starts (background preload)
swapQRCodes() executes after 50ms
setIsUpdating(true) → opacity drops to 90%
setQrCodeUrl(newUrl) → image src changes
Browser processes new data URL (1-5ms flash)
setIsUpdating(false) → opacity returns to 100%
The 50ms timeout is too aggressive for the image processing pipeline. The flash occurs during step 6 when the browser replaces the image source before the new data URL is fully rendered.

what is the difference between pending holds and holds

5 hours ago
DT

fortitude2030
Looking at the settlement system, I can explain the difference between "pending holds" and "holds":

Settlement Status Flow:
1. Pending (Initial State)

Settlement request is submitted but not yet reviewed
Awaiting admin/finance officer action
No decision made yet
2. Hold (Active Hold State)

Settlement has been reviewed and placed on hold
Admin/finance officer has actively decided to pause processing
Requires specific hold reason (e.g. "documentation incomplete", "verification needed")
Settlement is temporarily blocked from approval
3. Pending Hold vs Hold:

Pending Hold - Not a real status, but refers to settlements that might be put on hold during review

Hold - Actual status where settlement is actively blocked with a reason

Key Differences:
Status	Who Acts	Action Required	Next Steps
Pending	Admin/Finance	Review & decide	Approve, Reject, or Hold
Hold	Admin/Finance	Provide hold reason	Resolve issue & re-review
Approved	System	Auto-process	Transfer funds
Rejected	Admin/Finance	Provide reject reason	Request closed
Hold Reasons Include:

Documentation incomplete
Amount verification needed
Compliance review required
Technical issues
Account verification pending
The hold status allows temporary suspension without permanent rejection, giving time to resolve issues before final approval.

Funds put on hold must be calculated same as pending hold in the system. How would this look. Describe do not implement

DT

fortitude2030
Looking at the settlement system, funds on hold should be calculated and displayed identically to pending funds since both represent committed but unprocessed amounts. Here's how this would look:

Financial Calculation Perspective:
Current State:

Pending settlements: ZMW 50,000 (awaiting review)

Calculation Logic:
Committed Funds = Pending + Hold

Both statuses prevent new settlement creation
Both count against available balance
Both appear in "funds awaiting settlement" totals
Both block merchant withdrawal of committed amounts
Key Principle: From a financial perspective, "pending" and "hold" are identical - both represent committed funds that cannot be used elsewhere until the settlement process completes (approved/rejected).

The only difference is administrative workflow, not financial impact.

What is settlement capacity in the finance portal. What is the logic

Let me examine the settlement capacity logic in the finance portal to explain how it works.
So settlement capacity must always less than master balance?

3 hours ago
DT

fortitude2030
Yes, Settlement Capacity will always be less than or equal to Master Balance.

Here's why:

Mathematical Relationship:
Settlement Capacity = Master Balance - Processing Settlements
Since Processing Settlements is always ≥ 0 (you can't have negative pending settlements), the Settlement Capacity will always be:

Less than Master Balance when there are pending/hold settlements
Equal to Master Balance when there are no processing settlements
Real-world Examples:
Scenario 1 - With Processing Settlements:

Master Balance: ZMW 100,000
Processing: ZMW 25,000
Settlement Capacity: ZMW 75,000 (less than master)
Scenario 2 - No Processing Settlements:

Master Balance: ZMW 100,000
Processing: ZMW 0
Settlement Capacity: ZMW 100,000 (equal to master)
Scenario 3 - Heavy Processing Load:

Master Balance: ZMW 50,000
Processing: ZMW 45,000
Settlement Capacity: ZMW 5,000 (much less than master)
Business Purpose:
This design prevents over-commitment of funds. The system ensures you can never create settlement requests that exceed available funds, maintaining financial integrity and preventing scenarios where the organization commits more money than it actually has available.

The Settlement Capacity acts as a financial safety buffer that accounts for all outstanding obligations before allowing new commitments.

Using that logic, why is the settlement capacity higher than the master balance in the finance officer? This looks like an error

The fix includes multiple safeguards ensuring the calculation follows the formula (Master Balance - Processing) while preventing any negative values or exceeding the available funds. Please test the settlement capacity display in the Finance Portal to confirm it shows the correct values.
Can you confirm that it also resets to 0 every day at midnight? Just answer dont fix

3 hours ago
DT

fortitude2030
No, settlement capacity does not reset to 0 at midnight.

Settlement capacity is calculated in real-time using this formula:

Settlement Capacity = Master Balance - Processing Settlements
It's a dynamic calculation that changes whenever:

Master balance changes (money in/out of the wallet)
Processing settlements change (new pending/hold settlements added or existing ones approved/rejected)
The settlement capacity represents the current available funds for new settlement requests at any given moment, not a daily allowance that resets.

What DOES reset at midnight are the daily transaction limits for wallets, but settlement capacity is purely based on available funds and outstanding commitments.

Why is settlement capacity still showing 237541??

3 hours ago
DT

fortitude2030
Looking at the debug logs, I can see the issue. The settlement capacity is correctly calculated as ZMW 237,541, which equals the master balance because there are 0 pending settlements. This is actually the correct behavior.

The debug data shows:

Master Balance: ZMW 237,541
Pending Total: ZMW 0 (no pending or hold settlements)
Settlement Capacity: ZMW 237,541 (237,541 - 0 = 237,541)
This means the settlement capacity equals the master balance, which is correct when there are no processing settlements. The settlement capacity should only be less than the master balance when there are pending or hold settlements that reduce the available capacity.

So the current display of ZMW 237,541 is mathematically correct. The settlement capacity will only decrease when:

New settlement requests are created with "pending" status
Settlement requests are placed on "hold"
The master balance decreases
The fix I implemented prevents the capacity from exceeding the master balance, but when there are no processing settlements, the capacity correctly equals the full master balance.

Master balance should be equal to (today's collection - processing). This should also update the settlement capacity. Is this correct? Ask before you make changes

3 hours ago
DT

fortitude2030
You're asking about changing the master balance calculation to:

Master Balance = Today's Collection - Processing

This would fundamentally change the financial logic. Currently:

Master Balance = actual wallet funds (persistent across days)
Settlement Capacity = Master Balance - Processing
Your proposed change would make:

Master Balance = daily collections minus processing (resets daily)
Settlement Capacity = (Today's Collection - Processing) - Processing = Today's Collection - (2 × Processing)
Questions before implementing:

Should the master balance reset to 0 at midnight and only show today's collections?
Should historical wallet funds be ignored in favor of daily activity only?
How should this handle days with no collections (would master balance be 0 or negative)?
Should "today's collection" include merchant collections, completed transactions, or both?
This is a significant business logic change that would affect all financial calculations. Should I proceed with this modification, or would you like to clarify the intended financial model first?

No dont apply changes. I think a issue is that we are using similar labels across different roles, even though the function is different. So, the label master balance in the finance portal might mean something else in another portal. If this is so, then it would cause logic issues because we expect different results and calculations in different roles.

For example, would expect settlement capacity in the finance portal to equal today's collection minus processing. But if the calculations is pulling master balance.

what is your solution or suggestion?

3 hours ago
DT

fortitude2030
You've identified a critical design flaw. The term "Master Balance" is indeed creating confusion because it means different things across roles:

Current Confusion:
Finance Portal: "Master Balance" = organization's total wallet funds
Merchant Portal: "Master Balance" = merchant's individual wallet
Admin Portal: "Master Balance" = system-wide view
Suggested Solution - Role-Specific Terminology:
Finance Portal:
"Organization Funds" instead of "Master Balance"
"Today's Collections" = sum of all merchant daily collections
"Settlement Capacity" = Today's Collections - Processing
Merchant Portal:
"Wallet Balance" instead of "Master Balance"
Keep existing daily collection tracking
Admin Portal:
"System Total" for overall financial view
"Organization Funds" when viewing specific organizations
Implementation Strategy:
Update UI labels to be role-specific and descriptive
Separate calculation logic for each portal type
Create role-based financial functions instead of shared generic ones
Document the business rules for each role's financial display
This would eliminate the logic confusion where Finance expects daily-based calculations but gets persistent wallet totals. Each role would have clear, appropriately-named financial metrics that match their operational needs.

Should I implement this role-specific terminology and calculation separation?

would you need to make other changes, e.g to the flow?

3 hours ago
DT

fortitude2030
Yes, implementing role-specific terminology would require several flow changes:

Required Changes:
1. API Response Structure
Finance Portal needs todaysCollections instead of just wallet balance
Separate endpoints or response fields for role-specific data
Calculate merchant collections aggregation for finance view
2. Database Queries
Finance Portal: Query all merchant wallets + daily collections
Current: Single wallet query
Need aggregation logic for organization-wide daily totals
3. Settlement Request Validation
Finance Portal: Validate against todaysCollections - processing
Current: Validates against persistent wallet balance
Different business rules for available funds
4. Real-time Updates
Finance Portal: Refresh when ANY merchant completes transactions
Current: Only refreshes on finance user's direct activity
Broader WebSocket event listening needed
5. Daily Reset Logic
Finance Portal settlement capacity would reset to 0 at midnight
Current: Persistent across days
New midnight reset behavior for collections-based capacity
6. Error Handling
Different insufficient funds messages per role
Finance: "Exceeds today's collections"
Merchant: "Exceeds wallet balance"
7. Reporting/Analytics
Role-specific dashboards with appropriate metrics
Finance: Daily/monthly collection trends
Current: Generic transaction history
The changes would affect the entire financial calculation foundation, requiring careful migration to avoid breaking existing functionality while introducing the new role-specific logic.

Error Handling Changes for Role-Specific Finance Logic
Current Generic Errors:
// Same error for all roles
"Insufficient funds in wallet"
"Amount exceeds available balance"
Proposed Role-Specific Error Handling:
Finance Portal Errors:
// When settlement request exceeds today's collections
"Settlement amount (ZMW 50,000) exceeds today's collections (ZMW 30,000)"
// When no collections available
"No collections available today. Settlement capacity: ZMW 0"
// When processing settlements block capacity
"Available capacity: ZMW 15,000 (Collections: ZMW 40,000 - Processing: ZMW 25,000)"
// Daily reset notification
"Settlement capacity reset at midnight. Current collections: ZMW 0"
Merchant Portal Errors:
// Traditional wallet-based errors
"Transaction amount exceeds wallet balance (ZMW 5,000 available)"
"Daily limit reached (ZMW 50,000). Resets at midnight"
Admin Portal Errors:
// System-wide context
"Organization capacity insufficient across all merchants"
"Settlement would exceed system liquidity limits"
Error Context Enhancement:
Time-Sensitive Errors:
Finance errors include collection timeframes
Show time until next reset/capacity refresh
Display merchant activity affecting capacity
Actionable Error Messages:
Finance: "Wait for merchant collections or reduce amount"
Merchant: "Transfer funds from another wallet or wait for daily reset"
Admin: "Review organization liquidity or approve pending settlements"
Progressive Error States:
Warning: Approaching limits (80% capacity used)
Soft Block: Exceeds current but possible later
Hard Block: Mathematically impossible until reset
This creates clear, role-appropriate guidance that matches each user's operational context and available actions.

I'll make the requested changes to the settlement capacity card:
todays usage must only reflect approved settlements for today, not pending. what are the implications of this change with other dependencies if any? do not make changes, just answer

1 hour ago
DT

fortitude2030
Looking at the current implementation and the proposed change, here are the implications:

Current State Analysis
todaysUsage currently includes: pending + hold + approved settlements from today
Settlement capacity calculation: Today's Collections - Today's Usage
This ensures approved settlements immediately reduce available capacity
Proposed Change Impact
If todaysUsage only reflects approved settlements from today:

1. Settlement Capacity Calculation
Current: Collections - (pending + hold + approved)
Proposed: Collections - (approved only)
Result: Available capacity would be higher since pending/hold settlements wouldn't reduce it
2. User Experience Changes
Users could potentially over-request settlements since pending amounts won't show as "used"
Multiple pending settlements could collectively exceed daily capacity
Finance officers might approve settlements that push total usage over daily collections
3. Business Logic Dependencies
Settlement validation: Server-side validation in /api/settlement-requests currently uses todaysUsage to prevent over-requesting
Display consistency: The "Today's Usage" card would show different values than what's used for capacity calculations
Admin dashboard: Settlement approval process relies on this for capacity checks
4. Potential Issues
Race conditions: Multiple users could submit settlements simultaneously, all seeing the same "available" amount
Over-allocation: Daily capacity could be exceeded if multiple pending settlements get approved
Accounting mismatch: UI shows one thing, validation uses another
5. Required Changes
If implemented, you'd need to:

Update settlement creation validation to use a different calculation
Modify the capacity display logic to be clearer about what's being shown
Potentially add warnings when total pending + approved exceeds collections
The current implementation appears intentionally designed to prevent over-allocation by immediately reserving capacity when settlements are requested, not just when approved.

I understand you want to restructure the finance UI. Let me clarify the proposed changes:

Current Layout

Organization Funds Card - shows wallet balance
Proposed Layout
Today's Collections Card - shows collections amount + breakdown details (replacing the Settlement Capacity card)
Organization Funds Card - remains the same
Questions:
Card Title: Should the new card be titled "Today's Collections" or something else like "Daily Collections Summary"?

Breakdown Details: In the new Today's Collections card, what 3 columns should be displayed? For example:

Collections / Usage / Available?
Collections / Pending / Available?
Something else?
Available Amount: Since "Available" (settlement capacity) will still be shown in the breakdown, should it remain the prominent large number at the top of the card, or should "Today's Collections" be the main display?

Visual Styling: Should the new card keep the same green color scheme, or switch to blue (since it's more about collections than capacity)?

Information Hierarchy: Should any additional collection-related details be added to this card that aren't currently shown?

The change makes sense since "Settlement Capacity" and "Available" essentially show the same calculated value.

"Today's Collections"
"Daily Collections Summary"
"Settlement Overview"
Something else?
Subtitle Text: Currently it says "Available for New Settlements" - should this change to something like:

"Total collected today"
"Daily collection summary"
Keep the current subtitle?
Color Scheme: Should the card maintain the green theme (since it's still about capacity/availability) or switch to blue (since the headline focuses on collections)?

Breakdown Columns: Keep the current 3 columns (Today's Usage, Pending, Available) or modify them?

This approach makes sense - it consolidates the information into one card while keeping the collections amount prominently displayed.
